**Ciao!** My name is Federico Sossai and I don't snack during talks &#x1F609;.

[Among other things](./others), I'm a third-year PhD student at
[Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html)
and part of the [ARCANA Lab](https://github.com/arcana-lab) led by
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec). 

# &#x1F526; Research
At the moment I'm working on **parallelizing compilers**.
Parallelism in scientific codes has been studied for decades with remarkable results.
The time has come for "less-scientific" codes to get de-sequentialized.

In my vision, a *powerful langugage* allows users to express high-level concepts
and properties of their algorithms, while a *powerful compiler* should exploit them
and minimize the performance cost of the abstractions that permit such expressiveness.

Nobody focusing on an algorithm enojys being distracted by a code that quickly gets
unreadable and inflexible because of tedious implementation details.

When single-core performance is not enough, the problem is exacerbated by
parallelelization techniques that requires restructuring of data collections.
This is why I'm investigating the following questions:
1. What is hindering compilers from **extracting parallelism** from sequential programs?
2. How can high-level **data collections** boost (semi-)automatic parallelelization?

I believe that in the advent of an even more heterogeneous future, the importance of a compiler
that understands and manipulates parallelism will be hard to overstate.

# &#x1FAB6; About Me

My passion for computers began early in my life: in middle school my strong aptitude for
programming started emerging, eventually guiding me towards university, where I found out
how much I love to study computer science, think of new ideas and tackle challenging problems.
At the [University of Padova](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), Italy, I earned a solid
mathematical background (calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, probability theory with
applications) and I bolstered my skills in the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms,
greedy and dynamic programming approaches.

During my Masterâ€™s years I really enjoyed reasoning about approximation and randomization
techniques applied to NP-Hard problems together with designing effective heuristics.
