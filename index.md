**Ciao!** My name is Federico Sossai and I don't snack during talks &#x1F609;.

Among other things, I'm a PhD student at
[Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html)
and part of the [ARCANA Lab](https://github.com/arcana-lab) led by
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec).

# &#x1F526; Research

At the moment I'm working on **parallelizing compilers**.

In my vision, a good compiler plays a fundamental role in bridging the gap
between programmer **intentions** and tedious implementation details.

Nobody wants to deal with unreadable, unmaintainable and unportable parallel
code but the world where performance or memory consumption really matter 
seems to leave us with no other choice. This is why I'm investigating the following
questions:
1. What is hindering compilers from **extracting parallelism** from sequential programs?
2. Could high-level **data collections** be a game-changer for automatic parallelelization?

I believe that in the advent of an even more heterogeneous future, the importance of a compiler
that understands and manipulates parallelism will be hard to overstate.

# &#x1FAB6; About Me

My passion for computers began early in my life: in middle school my strong aptitude for
programming started emerging, eventually guiding me towards university, where I found out
how much I love to study computer science, think of new ideas and tackle challenging problems.
At the [University of Padova](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), Italy, I earned a solid
mathematical background (calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, probability theory with
applications) and I bolstered my skills in the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms,
greedy and dynamic programming approaches.

During my Masterâ€™s years I really enjoyed reasoning about approximation and randomization
techniques applied to NP-Hard problems together with designing effective heuristics.
