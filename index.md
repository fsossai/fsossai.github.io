Hello, my name is Federico Sossai, I am a PhD student at Northwestern University.

# Research

At the moment I'm working on optimizing and parallelizing compilers advised by 
Simone Campanoni. 

## My Story

My passion for computers began early in my life: in middle school my strong aptitude for
programming started emerging, eventually guiding me towards university, where I found out how
much I love to study computer science, think of new ideas and tackle challenging problems.
At the University of Padova, Italy, I earned a solid mathematical background (calculus, linear
algebra, discrete math, probability theory with applications) and I bolstered my skills in the analysis
of divide-and-conquer algorithms, greedy and dynamic programming approaches. During my Masterâ€™s
years I really enjoyed reasoning about approximation and randomization techniques applied to NP-
Hard problems together with designing effective heuristics. Now I feel confident with C++, C,
Python, Linux scripting and I am familiar with Fortran, C# and Java. I'm planning on learning Rust
in the near future.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
