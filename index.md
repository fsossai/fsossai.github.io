**Ciao!** My name is Federico Sossai and I like trees.

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science PhD student at
[Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html)
and part of the [ARCANA Lab](https://github.com/arcana-lab) led by
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec). 

# &#x1F526; Research
In my vision, a compiler has high chances of being a programmer's best friend when it comes to developing parallel code for CPUs.
At the same time, static analyses struggle to infer opportunities for parallelism beyond highly regular array codes.
Even if alias analysis could be solved precisely and quickly, compilers would still have to face many _real_ data dependencies that are not at all easy to overcome.

_In fact, some code properties are simply not inferrable statically._

This is why I'm working on **new abstractions and IRs for parallelizing compilers** that capture and encode key properties essential for unlocking more parallelism.

I'm also interested in how **a compiler aware of data collections** could uncover new parallelization strategies that would be too burdensome for programmers to write.

# &#x1FAB6; About Me

I've always had a strong passion for programming.
I'm fascinated by how much structure can emerge when spoken ideas become written algorithms,
and how these structures come back again and again.

At the [University of Padova](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), I realized how
the love for learning did not only belong to computer science but extended to
all the disciplines ruled by the rigor of math.
For better or worse, calculus, electromagnetism, probability theory, and NP-completeness
forever changed how I look at the world, and there's no way back.
